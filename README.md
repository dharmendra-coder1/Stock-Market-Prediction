# Stock market prediction
Stock market prediction is a ML Model that provides real-time stock market data visualization and prediction.
used data analytics and machine learning to predict a model with historical 
data to predict the stock.

I used Python libraries such as NUMPY, matplotlib, YFINANCE,
seaborn, pandas, NUMPY, KERAS, SKLEARN in this project to build 
the forecasting models (LSTM).
